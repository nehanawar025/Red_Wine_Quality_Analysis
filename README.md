# Red_Wine_Quality_Prediction_Project

This project demonstrates a regression analysis to predict the quality of red wine.
Here 'quality' is the Output column. It utilizes Decision Tree Regression and Adaptive Boosting Regression techniques, implements K-Fold Cross Validation for robust evaluation, and showcases various performance metrics.

## Features

- Predicts red wine quality using Decision Tree Regression and Adaptive Boosting Regression.
- Utilizes K-Fold Cross Validation with 10 splits for comprehensive model evaluation.
- Evaluates models using key performance metrics, including MAE, R2, Explained Variance, and Max Error.
- Compares model performance using visual plots.

## Setup and Usage

1. Download the 'RedWineQuality.csv' dataset.
2. Open the project in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.
3. Run the code cells to perform wine quality prediction and analysis.

## Requirements

- Python3
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Results

The project showcases the effectiveness of Decision Tree Regression and Adaptive Boosting Regression for predicting wine quality based on chemical attributes. Key metrics such as MAE, R2, Explained Variance, and Max Error are used to evaluate and compare the models.
