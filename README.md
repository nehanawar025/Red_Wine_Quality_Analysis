# Red_Wine_Quality_Prediction_Project

This project demonstrates a regression analysis to predict the quality of red wine.
Here 'quality' is the Output column. It utilizes Decision Tree Regression and Adaptive Boosting Regression techniques, implements K-Fold Cross Validation for robust evaluation, and showcases various performance metrics.

## Features

- Predicts red wine quality using Decision Tree Regression and Adaptive Boosting Regression.
- Utilizes K-Fold Cross Validation with 10 splits for comprehensive model evaluation.
- Evaluates models using key performance metrics, including MAE, R2, Explained Variance, and Max Error.
- Compares model performance using visual plots.

## Setup and Usage

1. Download the 'RedWineQuality.csv' dataset.
2. Open the project in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.

## Requirements

- Python3
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Results

- Key metrics such as MAE, R2, Explained Variance, and Max Error are used to evaluate and compare between Decision Tree Regression and Adaptive Boosting Regression.
- <strong>Adaptive Boosting Regression</strong> is the more accurate model.
